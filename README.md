# emmanuelbarrymoore.com - A Digital Renaissance: From 2015 Relics to 2025 Rebirth! 🚀🔥

## A Decade in Digital Time: From Legacy Code to Cutting-Edge Craft

Imagine a digital artifact, hastily assembled in a 72-hour coding blitz back in 2015. That's the origin story of this platform. A raw expression of passion, built with PHP, HTML, vanilla JS, jQuery, and a dash of CSS – a portfolio of dreams, lacking the polish of a full-fledged backend or mobile support. And yes, a shoutout to Kristy Carrion's visionary contributions to VGS, patiently waiting for their grand unveiling in 2025!

Now, nearly a decade later, we're not just dusting off the cobwebs; we're igniting a full-blown digital renaissance! Starting **March 19th, 2025**, this project undergoes a radical transformation, a metamorphosis from legacy code to a modern, robust, and scalable platform. We're not just refactoring; we're architecting a masterpiece.

## The Rebirth: A Powerhouse Tech Stack

This rebuild isn't just an upgrade; it's a quantum leap, powered by:

* **C# (.NET):** The backbone, the brain – a robust and scalable backend powering the API and core logic.
* **TypeScript:** Type safety, maintainability, a developer's best friend – ensuring our frontend is as solid as it is sleek.
* **React:** Dynamic, responsive, engaging – crafting a user experience that's both intuitive and inspiring, enhanced by the elegance of Material-UI.
* **PostgreSQL:** The data fortress, the reliable backbone – providing a performant and scalable database (setup pending, but the vision is clear!).
* **PHP:** A nod to the past, a bridge to the future – some legacy elements may linger, reborn for specific tasks.

## Quick Start: Launch Your Local Development Rocket 🚀

Get this project blazing on your local machine or in Codespaces with these simple steps. Fire up two terminals – one for the server, one for the client.

### Prerequisites: Fueling Your Development Engine

* **Node.js (v16+):** The JavaScript runtime that keeps our frontend humming.
* **.NET SDK (v8.0+):** The powerhouse for our C# backend.
* **Git:** To clone, commit, and conquer.

### 1. Clone the Repository: Your Mission Control 🛰️

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/emmanuelbarrymoore.com.git](https://github.com/your-username/emmanuelbarrymoore.com.git)
cd emmanuelbarrymoore.com
2. Launch the Backend: Engaging Warp Drive ⚙️
Bash

cd server
dotnet restore
dotnet run --project PortfolioApi.csproj
URL: http://localhost:5000 (or your Codespaces equivalent).
Note: Database setup is in progress. API endpoints are currently fueled by mock data.
3. Ignite the Frontend: Engage Thrusters ⚛️
Bash

cd client
npm install
npm start
URL: http://localhost:3000 (or your Codespaces equivalent).
Troubleshooting: Encountered the "Module not found: './App'" error? Fear not! A quick rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install will reset the course.
4. Access the App: Your Digital Destination 🌐
Open your browser to the client URL. The React frontend will seamlessly connect to the backend API.

Troubleshooting: Navigating the Asteroid Field 🌠
Frontend Fails? Dive into the console (F12) for error messages. Ensure src/App.tsx and src/index.tsx are present and accounted for.
Backend Hiccups? Verify the .NET SDK is installed (dotnet --version) and PortfolioApi.csproj is nestled in the server/ directory.
Codespaces Chaos? A simple "Restart Codespace" (Gear icon → Restart Codespace) often realigns the stars.

A snapshot of the platform's 2016 state – a testament to ambition, a work in progress.

Current State: Charting the Course 🗺️
Frontend: Powered by Material-UI, echoing the 2015 layout with a modern twist. We're still fine-tuning App.tsx imports.
Backend: ASP.NET Core API is operational, patiently awaiting PostgreSQL integration.
Next Stop: The Final Frontier 🚀
Database migrations.
Interactive navigation tabs.
Porting legacy JavaScript logic.
Let's build something extraordinary! 🛠️✨
